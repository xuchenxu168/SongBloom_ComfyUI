## Lyric Format
_(You can ask GPT with the following prompt, please customize the content based on your requirements and double-check the generated lyrics, especially "," and ".")_

Please help me write original lyrics, which meet the following requirements:

- The lyrics contain both vocal and non-vocal sections. Vocal sections must contain a structure flag and lyric text, while non-vocal sections contain only structure flag;
- [verse] / [chorus] （sometimes [bridge]) is prepended to each vocal section, indicating the structure of vocal ragion;
- [intro] / [inst] / [outro] is used to fulfill the non-vocal section (optional). The structure flag will be repeated based on the duration of non-vocal section (eg., 5-second intro, then [intro] × 5). Short non-vocal sections can be ignored;
- For lyric text, "." is used to separate each sentence. "," is used to separate each section (only appears at the end of vocal and non-vocal sections except the last one);
- The lyrics should contain at least one vocal section, and the expected length of song should be around 2 minutes.
